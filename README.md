# Loan-Connector

## Description

Loan-Connector is an MVP developed for Blockchain at Michigan's 2021 Summer Cohort Final Project. The project is not complete but features blockchain based 
user authentication and the ability to borrow of ERC-20 "USDX" tokens. Next steps include allowing depositors to supply "USDX" to borrowers and refining the UI/UX.
